 ## Build Status
 
-**Zig 0.15.2 Migration Complete** - Build and tests passing with 0 errors
+**Zig 0.15.2 Migration Complete** - Build and tests passing with 0 errors (Completed: February 28, 2026)
 
 ## Recent Updates
 
-- **Memory Leak Fixes**: Implemented `Config.deinit()` to free allocated fields
-- **ArrayList API**: Corrected `toOwnedSlice()` usage across WhatsApp channel and provider modules
-- **Test Fixes**: Resolved memory leaks in test fixtures and corrected error type expectations
-- **Knowledge Base Skill**: Updated for Zig 0.15.2 compatibility
+- **Zig 0.15.2 Migration** (February 28, 2026): All 11 phases finalized with zero errors
+- **ArrayList API**: Fixed `toOwnedSlice()` across all 9 skill modules (nufast_physics, knowledge_base, semantic_search, local_llm, adhd_workflow, dirmacs_docs, planckeon_sites, discovery, memory_tree_search)
+- **Thread Safety**: Added mutex protection to WhatsApp channel shared state; eliminated global mutable state via per-execution skill instances
+- **HTTP Robustness**: Implemented configurable request timeouts in NIMClient (default 30s) to prevent hangs
+- **Type Safety**: Replaced all 31 `@intCast` occurrences with validated `std.math.cast` and error propagation across 18 files
+- **Error Handling**: Reviewed 117 `catch unreachable` patterns; kept unreachable where genuinely impossible (with comments), propagated errors in test fixtures
+- **Testing & Quality**: Restored integration tests with proper Config; added unit tests for ConfigLoader error paths; thread safety stress tests for WhatsApp channel
+- **Production Hardening**: Config validation at startup; StateStore.save() with atomic writes; structured logging; graceful shutdown (SIGINT/SIGTERM); health and Prometheus metrics endpoints
+- **Memory & Security**: Fixed Config.deinit() to prevent leaks; removed sensitive credentials from logs; corrected errdefer in ConfigLoader
